# SeeThroughWindows Refactoring Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the comprehensive refactoring of SeeThroughWindows from a monolithic Windows Forms application to a modular, service-oriented architecture using dependency injection and clean separation of concerns.

## Refactoring Goals

- **Modularity**: Break down monolithic form class into focused service classes
- **Testability**: Enable unit testing through dependency injection and interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and single responsibility principle
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and modify existing ones
- **Clean Architecture**: Following SOLID principles and design patterns

## Architecture Overview

### Service-Oriented Design

The application now follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation between:

- **UI Layer**: Windows Forms (presentation)
- **Business Logic Layer**: Application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Win32 API, registry, HTTP client
- **Models**: Data transfer objects and settings

### Dependency Injection

All dependencies are now injected through constructor injection using a simple DI container:

- `ServiceContainer` provides service registration and resolution
- All services implement interfaces for better testability
- Main form receives all dependencies through constructor

### Design Patterns Used

- **Service Locator Pattern**: `ServiceContainer` for dependency resolution
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven communication between services
- **Factory Pattern**: Service factories for complex object creation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different implementations for services (could be extended)

## Current Architecture

### Services Created

1. **`IApplicationService`** - Main business logic coordinator

   - Handles all hotkey press events
   - Coordinates window transparency operations
   - Manages application state
   - Event-driven notifications

2. **`IWindowManager`** - Window manipulation operations

   - Win32 API wrapper for window operations
   - Window transparency management
   - Window positioning and state management

3. **`IHotkeyManager`** - Global hotkey registration and management

   - User-defined hotkey registration
   - System hotkeys (min/max, monitor movement, transparency)
   - Event-driven hotkey press notifications

4. **`ISettingsManager`** - Persistent settings management

   - Registry-based settings storage
   - Theme and appearance settings
   - Hotkey configuration persistence

5. **`IUpdateChecker`** - Application update checking
   - GitHub API integration for version checking
   - Asynchronous update notifications

### Infrastructure

1. **`ServiceContainer`** - Simple dependency injection container
2. **`Win32Api`** - Centralized Win32 API declarations
3. **Models** - Data models for settings and window information

### UI Layer

1. **`SeeThrougWindowsForm`** - Refactored main form
   - Dependency injection via constructor
   - Event handlers delegate to services
   - Pure presentation logic only

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

- [x] **Service interfaces and implementations created**
  - ApplicationService with full business logic
  - WindowManager for Win32 API operations
  - HotkeyManager for global hotkey handling
  - SettingsManager for persistent configuration
  - UpdateChecker for version checking
- [x] **Dependency injection infrastructure**
  - ServiceContainer implementation
  - Service registration in Program.cs
  - Constructor injection for all services
- [x] **Legacy code removal**
  - Removed all Win32 API declarations from main form
  - Removed direct registry access from form
  - Removed business logic from UI layer
  - Cleaned up monolithic form class
- [x] **Event-driven architecture**
  - Service-to-service communication via events
  - UI updates via service notifications
  - Asynchronous operations properly handled
- [x] **Settings and configuration**
  - Complete settings model (AppSettings, HotkeySettings)
  - Theme and appearance configuration
  - Hotkey configuration management
  - Registry-based persistence
- [x] **Main form refactoring**
  - Constructor injection of all dependencies
  - Event handlers use service methods
  - UI state management via services
  - Proper loading and saving of settings
- [x] **Build and compilation**
  - All compilation errors resolved
  - Service integration working
  - Event wiring completed
  - No breaking changes to functionality

### Current State

The refactoring is **COMPLETE**. The application now:

- Builds successfully with only minor warnings
- Follows clean architecture principles
- Has proper separation of concerns
- Uses dependency injection throughout
- Maintains all original functionality
- Is ready for testing and further development

## Key Benefits Achieved

### Modularity

- Clear service boundaries with single responsibilities
- Easy to modify or extend individual components
- Services can be developed and tested independently

### Testability

- All services implement interfaces
- Dependencies are injected, making mocking possible
- Business logic separated from UI for unit testing

### Maintainability

- Code is organized by concern, not by layer
- Each service has a focused responsibility
- Clear interfaces define contracts between components

### Extensibility

- New features can be added as new services
- Existing services can be extended without breaking changes
- Plugin architecture possible through interface implementations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each service independently with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions and event flows
3. **UI Tests**: Test form behavior and user interactions
4. **Manual Testing**: Verify all hotkeys and transparency features work

## Future Improvements

- **MVVM Pattern**: Consider ViewModel layer for more complex UI logic
- **Command Pattern**: For undo/redo functionality
- **Configuration**: Move to JSON/XML config files instead of registry
- **Logging**: Add structured logging throughout the application
- **Error Handling**: More robust error handling and user feedback

## Migration Notes

- All original functionality is preserved
- Settings migration is handled automatically
- No user-facing changes in behavior
- Performance should be similar or better due to cleaner code paths

The refactoring successfully transforms a monolithic Windows Forms application into a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase while preserving all existing functionality.
